# Ownership

Ownership refers to the rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.  These rules are checked at compile time, and if any of the rules are being violated, then the program won't compile.  This provides two benefits:

1. The programmer isn't required to explicitly allocate and free memory, and
2. No garbage collector is needed at run time.
